*Parking Management System*
This project is a C++ implementation of a parking management system. It allows admin to manage parking slots by adding vehicles, counting the number of vehicles, and calculating the total amount of time vehicles have been parked. 
The system provides a detailed output of vehicle information, including the vehicle number, date, arrival time, and departure time.
Key Features:
*Add Vehicle*: Users can add vehicles to the parking system with their details, including vehicle number, date, arrival time, and departure time.
*Count Vehicles*: The system can count the number of vehicles currently parked.
*Total amount*: The total amount of time vehicles have been parked can be calculated.
Output Format:
The system provides a detailed output in the following format


Type    Vehicle Number    Date          Arrival Time          Departure Time 
1			   mh121221			  20/5/2023			    10:30:30			       10:45:23
2			   mh121551			  20/5/2023			    10:53:23			       12:53:23
1			   mh122625			  20/5/2023			    13:45:26			       14:2:23
1			   mh122728			  20/5/2023			    14:3:23			         15:10:23

Future Enhancements:
The system can be further enhanced by adding features such as:
-Handling multiple parking slots
-Implementing a payment system
-Providing real-time updates on parking availability
